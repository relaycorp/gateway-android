Awala enables compatible apps on your device to remain connected when the Internet has been cut off by repressive regimes, natural disasters, etc.

When the Internet is available, Awala-compatible apps will just use it seamlessly and you won't have to interact with this app (though your apps will still use it behind the scenes).

When the Internet has been cut off, you'll rely on Awala couriers to send and receive data from the Internet. A courier is someone who transports data between a region disconnected from the Internet and a location connected to the Internet.

Once you've located a courier who's willing to transport your data, this app will guide you through the process of exchanging data with them. Fortunately, it's a very simple process: You just have to connect to the courier's WiFi network and Awala will do the rest. (Note that WiFi is only used to exchange data at a location disconnected to the Internet; you won't be able to reach the Internet through the courier's device)

Awala keeps your data safe: Couriers, or anyone who intercepts them, can't see or change your apps' data. Nor can anyone see which apps you're using, besides Awala itself.
